# Nick Pfister

I'm an experienced software engineer currently on a planned career break to visit 20+ countries across Africa, Europe, and South America. Previously, I was a features engineer on the hit mobile game [Disney Emoji Blitz][emojiBlitz]. Before that, I founded Planetary Gaming, which was selected for the highly competitive [StartupUCLA Accelerator][startupUCLA] and the Barry Eggers seed prize.

While I travel, I'm using my free time to become a better programmer, writing code all over the planet (including on a big yellow truck driving through some of the worst roads in Africa). Right now, my focus is on honing my iOS, macOS, and Metal skills using Swift, Objective-C, and C++.

I'll be returning to my home in Los Angeles in April 2024 and am already on the lookout for the next opportunity.

**Skills:** Swift, C#, C++, Objective-C, Unity, SwiftUI, SOLID Design, Test Driven Development, Git, Algorithms, 3D Math.  
**Education:** UCLA, Astrophysics - 2017
