I worked on [Disney Emoji Blitz][emojiBlitz] for over 3 years as a software engineer. During this time I built countless new features ranging in size from small to monolithic with development times lasting anywhere from a few days to half a year.

To accomplish these tasks, I worked in a cross functional team of designers, artists, animators, and more. As the lead engineer for many features during my tenure, I often was the first person to discover holes in the design or other kinks that needed to be worked out in a group setting. This meant I regularly took on an ownership role beyond simply translating design documents into code - creating a culture of communication and collaboration to make sure our product was the best it could possibly be.

Some of my most notable contributions to Emoji Blitz include...
- *Photo Hunt Event*: a monolithic new game type built upon legacy systems unknown to current teammates.
- *Premium Prize Wheel*: a new IAP product whose bug-free launch contributed in making it the most profitable feature in the entire companyâ€™s portfolio.
- *Weekly Prize Calendar*: a daily reward track and the front-most player facing feature viewed by every player, every day.
