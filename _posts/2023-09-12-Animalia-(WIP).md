Inspired by and executed on an 8000 mile road trip from Nairobi, Kenya to Cape Town, South Africa, Animalia is an app created in harsh physical conditions with little to no internet connection.

I was hoping to find inspiration for my next big project when we first arrived in Nairobi, and I was quick to find it when we took our first wildlife tour of Nakuru National Park. In the span of just one day, we had seen over a dozen species of mammals ranging from the Vervet Monkey to the White Rhinoceros. I wanted some way to take note of everything we would see on our way down the continent, but I quickly realized that would be difficult to do with sparse internet connection to look up the names of animals in the area. I could buy a reference book and take notes on my phone, but wouldn't it be nice if I could do it all in one place?

Flash forward to the next internet cafè we stopped at and I downloaded a database of all living or recently extinct mammals in the world, complete with location data. Over the next two months, I used every spare moment possible (often while riding on a bumpy road in a big yellow truck) to pull this data into a SwiftUI app which allows you to search for species in a given region and mark them as "collected" - with the option of adding pictures. Think real life *Pokémon Snap*!

This ended up being useful to me and others on our trip - I alone collected around 40 unique mammal species on our long journey. Most importantly, it taught me a new way of developing - without internet connection. All I had was Xcode's built in developer documentation and the occasional StackOverflow response that I would export to PDF at the rare internet cafè. Though difficult at first, I eventually found myself more willing and patient to work through and solve problems on my own. And with no internet, there was also little else to distract me!

I'm still continuing to work on this app having left Africa, and I plan on releasing it to the public when we return home.
