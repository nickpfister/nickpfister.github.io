      <h1>Disney Emoji Blitz</h1>
<p><b>10 Sep 2023 - Nick Pfister</b></p>

<div class="post">
<p>I worked on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-emoji-blitz-game/id1017551780">Disney Emoji Blitz</a> for over 3 years as a software engineer. During this time I built countless new features ranging in size from small to monolithic with development times lasting anywhere from a few days to half a year.</p>

<p>To accomplish these tasks, I worked in a cross functional team of designers, artists, animators, and more. As the lead engineer for many features during my tenure, I often was the first person to discover holes in the design or other kinks that needed to be worked out in a group setting. This meant I regularly took on an ownership role beyond simply translating design documents into code - creating a culture of communication and collaboration to make sure our product was the best it could possibly be.</p>

<p>Some of my most notable contributions to Emoji Blitz include…</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Photo Hunt Event</em>: a monolithic new game type built upon legacy systems unknown to current teammates.</li>
  <li><em>Premium Prize Wheel</em>: a new IAP product whose bug-free launch contributed in making it the most profitable feature in the entire company’s portfolio.</li>
  <li><em>Weekly Prize Calendar</em>: a daily reward track and the front-most player facing feature viewed by every player, every day.</li>
</ul>
